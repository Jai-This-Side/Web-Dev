        <p>Allopathic medicine, or allopathy, is an archaic and derogatory label originally used by 19th-century
            homeopaths
            to describe heroic medicine, the precursor of modern evidence-based medicine. There are regional
            variations in usage of the term. In the United States, the term is sometimes used to contrast with
            osteopathic
            medicine, especially in the field of medical education. In India, the term is used to distinguish
            conventional
            modern medicine from Siddha, Ayurveda, homeopathy, Unani and other alternative and traditional medicine
            traditions, especially when comparing treatments and drugs.</p>

        <p>Homeopathy is an alternative medical practice that was developed in the late 1700s. Homeopathy is generally
            based
            on two main principles:
            <br>
            that a substance that causes symptoms in a healthy person can be used in diluted form to treat symptoms and
            illnesses, a principle known as “like-cures-like”; and
            the more diluted the substance, the more potent it is, which is known as the “law of infinitesimals.”
            <br>
            Historically, homeopathic products have been identified through “provings,” in which substances are
            administered
            to healthy volunteers in concentrations that cause symptoms. Symptoms experienced by volunteers are recorded
            to
            indicate possible therapeutic uses for the substances. In other words, if a substance causes a particular
            symptom, individuals experiencing that symptom would be treated with a diluted solution made from that
            substance.

        <h1><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayurveda">Ayurvedic Medicine</a></h1>
        <p>Ayurveda is an alternative medicine system with historical roots in the Indian subcontinent. It is heavily
            practiced in India and Nepal, where around 80% of the population report using Ayurveda. The theory and
            practice
            of Ayurveda is pseudoscientific.
            <br>
            Ayurveda therapies have varied and evolved over more than two millennia. Therapies include herbal medicines,
            special diets, meditation, yoga, massage, laxatives, enemas, and medical oils. Ayurvedic preparations are
            typically based on complex herbal compounds, minerals, and metal substances (perhaps under the influence of
            early Indian alchemy or rasashastra). Ancient Ayurveda texts also taught surgical techniques, including
            rhinoplasty, kidney stone extractions, sutures, and the extraction of foreign objects
